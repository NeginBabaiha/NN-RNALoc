# NN-RNALoc: a neural network based model to predict the cellular location of mRNA

NN-RNALoc is a machine-learning based model to predict the sub-cellular location of mRNAs which is evaluated on two following datasets: Cefra-seq and RNALocate.  NN-RNALoc, a neural network-based predictive tool employs the features extracted from mRNA sequences along with the information gathered from their. 

## Dependency

NN-RNALoc is tested on Python version 3.69 and Keras 2.3.1. Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install packages, separately.

```bash
pip install keras==2.3.1 
```

## Running NN-RNALoc
To run NN-RNALoc, first unzip both rnalocate.zip and cefra-seq.zip files contained in Data directory. Then, unzip the PPIdata.zip file and put this information in the Scripts folder. Finally, from scripts open and run RNALocator.py.
