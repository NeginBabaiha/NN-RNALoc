# RNALocator: a neural network based model to predict the cellular location of mRNA

RNALocator is a machine-learning based model to predict the sub-cellular location of mRNAs which is based on two following datasets: Cefra-seq and RNALocate.

## Dependency

RNALocator is tested on Python version 3.69 and Keras 2.3.1. Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install packages, separately.

```bash
pip install keras==2.3.1 
```

## Running RNALocator
To run RNALocator, first unzip both rnalocate.zip and cefra-seq.zip files contained in Data directory. Then, unzip the PPIdata.zip file and put this information in the Scripts folder. Finally, from scripts open and run RNALocator.py.
